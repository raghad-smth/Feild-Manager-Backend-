# Feild Manager Backend Repo Workflow  

## Branching Strategy

To keep our work organized and clean, we are following this structure:

* **`main` branch**

  * This is our final, production-ready branch.
  * ðŸš« **Do not push directly to `main`**.
  * You can only merge into `main` through a **Pull Request (PR)**.

* **`development` branch**

  * Used to integrate tasks before merging them into `main`.
  * You can push your finished task branch here after testing it.

* **Task branches**

  * Each task has its own branch following this naming convention:

    ```
    development-<task-name>
    ```
  * ðŸš« Always switch to your **task branch** before working and pushing your changes.

## Workflow with GitHub Actions

Inside the `.github/workflows/` folder, youâ€™ll find our **YAML file**.

* This file configures **GitHub Actions**, which run automated checks (such as building and testing the project) whenever we push or open a Pull Request.
* Think of it as our projectâ€™s **automation script**: it makes sure everything works smoothly before merging changes.
